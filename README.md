Welcome! This is a basic project designed to store keys/access codes & "top secret information" from a user wanting to store their information within this local repository without their password & information being publicly seen (except for in the file where the information is stored for viewing purposes :D ) This project utilizes basic hacker attack prevention by hiding important information without really knowing what the user's information is besides their "secret". Their access code and other related info to achieve the selected piece of information is hidden even to the program storage.

Functionalities

The user will be able to submit a blurb of text needing to be "encrypted" by a key or access code. The information then will be stored within the "safe file". If the user wishes to access their information, they must submit the correct key/access code to obtain the blurb of text they had encrypted (the process of decryption).

Attributes

The file will contain only text related information. No other sources can be supported at this point.
The file will only contain UNIQUE keys. Phrases or blurbs of text can be repeated but each text or blurb will contain its own unique key.
The first version of the file can only hold 20 keys (and 20 pieces of encrypted information).
The file will be viewable by the public for functionality purposes.

Thank you!
