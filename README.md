# mochicrypt
Welcome! This is a basic project designed to create keys for a user wanting to store their information within this local repository without their information being publicly seen (except for in the file where the information is stored for viewing purposes :D ) 

Functionalities
The user will be able to submit a blurb of text needing to be "encrypted" by a key which will be generated by the provided program to be saved by the user. The information then will be stored within the "safe file". If the user wishes to access their information, they must submit the correct key to obtain the blurb of text they had encrypted (the process of decryption).

Attributes
The file will contain only text related information. No other sources can be supported at this point.
The file will only contain UNIQUE keys. Phrases or blurbs of text can be repeated but each text or blurb will contain its own unique key.
The first version of the file can only hold 20 keys (and 20 pieces of encrypted information).
The file will be viewable by the public for functionality purposes.

Thank you!
